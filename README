This is a simple koch curve generator.  It is built as a webserver that only outputs SVG so that I could do the following:

* Play with SVG
* Get graphical output without messing around with go-sdl or some other such library.

On the extremely odd chance that anyone sees this code.  It is trivial code that I wrote to play with.  So I consider it in the public domain.  If I ever make something nicer of it I may change to a formal open source license.
